				<h2>Hello my name is Aaron Poyser and welcome to my website!</h2><br />
				<p>I am just trying to publicise what I do and if there is anything that you would like to know, don't hesitate in contacting me.
				Currently I am studying at Staffordshire University topping up to an BSc Honours Degree for "Applied Computing"
				<br />
				Therefore this is a side project to do, as this will help me advertise what I specialise in and what my career path is going to be.
				<br />
				I am currently available for any website production that is required and would do the design to any purpose.</p>
