# MyWork

Please look through all of my work I have done, most of my HTML pages are PHP so they can be connected to a database, but I work around PHP to initalise includes. 

I use a bootstrap approach to all of my websites, but use custom stylesheets to style the internal structures of the webpage. I always ensure that my websites are responsive to suit mobile technologies.

I try to incorporate different styles dependent on the requirements of the client. So far I have adapted new technologies into my portfolio sites and have also included different example source code structures that I have used previously.
